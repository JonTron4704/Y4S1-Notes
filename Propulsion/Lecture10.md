# Turbofan Efficiency

The overall efficiency is:
- $\eta_0 = \eta_p \times \eta_{th}$

Use a high overall pressure ratio and high turbine inlet temperature to get good thermal efficiency. We laos need a low jet velocity to get a high propulsive efficiency. This creates the turbofan.

A turbofan also has transmission efficiency factored in:
- $\eta_0 = eta_p \times \eta_{th} \times \eta_{tr}$

We can redefine ther thermal efficiency as the kinetic energy that would be produced if the core flow expanded to ambient pressure BEFORE work extracted to drive bypass part of fan, divided by heat input from combustion.
- $\eta_{th} = \dfrac{\textrm{Kinetic energy that would be produced}}{\textrm{heat input from combustion}}$

This creates a hypothetical point within the low pressure turbine (LPT) when sufficient work could have been extracted, to power the fan root and booster but NOT the bypass stream
