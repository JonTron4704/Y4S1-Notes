# Design
- Formulate a plan to satisfy a specific need
- Process requires innovation, iteration and decision-making
- Communication intensive
- Products should be
  - Functional
  - Safe
  - Reliable
  - Competitive
  - Usable
  - Manufacturable

## Mechanical Engineering Design
- Involves all the disciplines of mechanical engineering
- Examples 
  - Journal bearing
    - Fluid flow (i.e. lubricant)
    - Heat transfer (i.e. parts heat up as the bearing spins)
    - Friction (causes heating)
    - Energy transport (efficient rotational energy transfer)
    - Material selection (should be wear resistant and sufficiently strong. Shaft should be hard, bearing should be soft)
    - Thermomechanical treatments (no idea)
    - etc

# Design Process
- Iterative in nature
- Requires initial estimation, followed by continuous refining
- Define the cost, quantity, expected life, operating temperature, and reliability
- Specified characteristics can niclude the speeds, temperature limitations, maximum range, expected variation in variables, dimension & weight limitations, etc...
- Invention of the concept

- Marketability
- Maintenance
- Volume
- Liability
- Remanufacturing/resource recovery

# Standards and Codes

## Standards
- A set of specifications for parts, materials or processes
- Intended to achieve uniformity, efficiency and a specified quality
- Limits the multitude of variations

## Codes
- Set of specifications for the analysis, design, manufacture and construction of something
- To achieve a specified degree of safety, efficiecny, performance and/or quality
- Does not imply absolute safety. Absolute safety is impossible.

# Cost
- Cost is always an important factor
- Using standard sizes (standards) is the first principle of cost reduction (see table A-17)
- Certain common components may be less expensive in stocked sizes

# Tolerance
- Variation of dimensions in a produced part.
- Defines the minimum and maximum acceptable dimensions, since exact dimensions are very difficult
- Close tolerances generally increase cost

# Breakeven Point
- Cost comparison between two possible production methods
- Often there is a breakeven point on quantity of production

Example
- Automatic screw machine
  - 25 parts/hr
  - 3 hr setup
  - $20/hr labor cost
- Hand Screw Machine
  - 10 parts/hr
  - Minimal setup
  - $20/hr labor cost

Hand Screw machine is desirable if the expected quantity is lower, since it is cheaper. If high quantity is needed, the automatic screw machine is better.

# Strength and Stress

Strength
- Inherent material property
- Depends on treatment and processing
- May or may not be uniform

Stress
- State property at a specific point
- Function of load and geometry

# Deterministic Method

- Establishes a design factor $n_p$
- Based on absolute uncertainty of a loss-of-function parameter and a maximum allowable parameter
- $n_d = \dfrac{\textrm{loss of function parameter}}{\textrm{maximum allowable parameter}}$
